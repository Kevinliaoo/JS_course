		<p>
			Inline elements are only able to move left and right, not up and
			down
		</p>
		<p>
			We can make inline elements to be able to move up and down by
			changing the display to inline-block
		</p>
		<p>
			inline-block elements acts like a inline element (it occupies
			neccesary ammount of space), but they are able to move up and down
		</p>

		<p>
			You can put inline elements inside a block element, but you can not
			put a block element inside an inline element
